<p class="govuk-body">Examples of variations include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>adding or changing an abstraction purpose (use)</li>
  <li>adding or changing an abstraction point</li>
  <li>increasing the volume of water to be abstracted, hourly, daily or annually</li>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Other options for sourcing water</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Reservoirs</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">If local water availability is low over summer and higher over winter, 
  building a reservoir is one option to ensure a more consistent water supply. 
  Read the <a href="">guide to planning, designing, constructing and commissioning a water storage 
  reservoir</a> for more information.</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><a href="">Local Resource Option (LRO)</a> is a water resource solution 
  designed to enhance water resilience or supply for a small group of abstractors 
  within their area. Owned, operated, and managed by the abstractors themselves. 
  LROs range from infrastructure projects like reservoirs and rainwater harvesting 
  systems to collaborative solutions such as water sharing agreements or licence pooling.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Water recycling and efficiency</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The Environment Agency believes <a href="">water recycling</a> 
  can play an effective and increasingly important role in securing 
  water supplies. Indirect recycling treats wastewater and discharges 
  it to an environmental buffer, such as a river, reservoir or 
  underground aquifer. Water is then abstracted and treated further to 
  drinking water standards.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Increasing water efficiency is also encouraged 
  when local water availability is low. Smart irrigation scheduling, 
  reducing leakages and reusing water for wash down are all options 
  to save water. <a href="">Waterwise</a> offer tips and information on water 
  efficiency and conservation.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Water supply agreements</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">You may be able to arrange a favourable bulk water 
    supply agreement from your local water company. Read more about 
    <a href="">bulk water supply agreements</a> on the Ofwat website, and 
    <a href="">look up your local supplier</a> on the Water UK website.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Rainwater and storage</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Rainwater harvesting is an efficient way to use water.</p>
 <p class="govuk-body">Harvested rainwater is rainwater:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>collected from roofs and other above ground surfaces</li>
  <li>collected via a system of above ground pipes and tanks</li>
  <li>isolated from inland waters or groundwater</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The Environment Agency will not regulate harvested 
rainwater provided its use does not harm the environment - either alone or 
combined with other abstractions or transfers. Rainwater harvesting 
within a catchment must not affect the normal watercourse flow.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You do not need an abstraction licence to use 
  water that only consists of harvested rainwater. However you may need 
  a water abstraction licence if you combine harvested rainwater with 
  ground or surface water, which you then abstract or transfer.</p>

 <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Desalination</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Desalination is the treatment of brackish (slightly salty 
  water from river estuaries) or seawater to remove dissolved salts and other 
  organic chemicals to provide a source of fresh water. After treatment, 
  this can be suitable for drinking. </p>

<p class="govuk-body">It is a more expensive and complicated option 
  to implement but is being used successfully in other countries and becoming more popular.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">For further information, take a look at the <a href="">Environment 
  Agency position statement on desalination for public water supply</a>.
