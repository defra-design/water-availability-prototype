        You do not need an abstraction licence for abstractions of 20 
        cubic metres or less a day, provided your abstraction is part 
        of a single operation.
      </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
         If you abstract from the same source at multiple points, 
         the exemption only applies if the combined total of all abstractions 
         is 20 cubic metres or less a day. Learn more
