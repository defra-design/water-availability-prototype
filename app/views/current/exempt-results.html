        Make sure you do not need a licence before abstracting water
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">It's important you comply with water and environmental regulations. 
 Make sure you are definitely exempt from licensing and consider whether you need any 
 other <a href="#" class="govuk-link">environmental permits</a> or 
 <a href="#" class="govuk-link">planning permissions</a> before you abstract water.</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><a href="#" class="govuk-link">Check if your intended water use is listed as an exemption.</a></p>

<p class="govuk-body">The Environment Agency carry out site inspections to 
  check compliance. If you commit an offence they may take enforcement action. 
  More information on fines and convictions are listed in 
  the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">water resources offence response</a> options.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you are unsure and need further guidance on 
    whether you need a licence, contact the Environment Agency.</p>
